# TaskMaster Next Steps: Strategic Improvements for Next-Generation Task Generation

## Executive Summary
This document outlines strategic improvements to transform TaskMaster from a basic task spec generator into an intelligent, context-aware project orchestration system. These enhancements focus on increasing task generation quality, leveraging project-wide context, and building accumulative knowledge systems.

## Core Improvements

### 1. Project Directory Analysis (Replace Single CLAUDE.md)
**Priority: HIGH | Effort: MEDIUM | Impact: VERY HIGH**

#### Current State
- Single CLAUDE.md file provides limited context
- Manual file path specification
- No understanding of actual project structure

#### Proposed Improvement
Full directory tree analysis with intelligent context extraction and indexing.

#### Implementation Details

  - Recursively analyze project directories
  - Extract and index: README files, package.json, .csproj, solution files
  - Map folder structures and identify key architectural patterns
  - Build file relationship graphs

- **Database Schema**:
  ```sql
  ProjectContext {
    Id, ProjectId, FilePath, FileType,
    Content, LastAnalyzed, Relationships
  }
  ```

- **UI Changes**:
  - Replace single file path input with directory picker
  - Add file pattern filters (include/exclude globs)
  - Show analysis progress and statistics
  - Cache control with manual refresh option

- **Features**:
